- **Description:** This project involves analyzing employee data to gain valuable insights into the demographics, distribution, and compensation of a technology company's workforce. In the exploration, cleansing, transformation, and analysis stages, MySQL is used to apply fundamental operations (CRUD), data definition languages (DDL), and data manipulation languages (DML), as well as aggregation functions and conditional expressions. Power BI is then used for data visualization.
