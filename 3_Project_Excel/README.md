## üß≠ Project Workflow

### üîç Data Preparation and Exploration
- Open the Excel file Project.xlsx.
- Create a copy of the Raw_data sheet.
- Rename the copied sheet as Clean_data.
. Convert the data in the Clean_data sheet into a table format.

### üßπ Data Cleaning

The result of the data cleaning process is shown in the Clean_data sheet.
- Apply the European date format **(DD-MM-YYYY)** to the Date column.
- Capitalize names in the Commercial Agent using the **PROPER()** function.
- Split the text in the Commercial Agent column into two columns using the **Data > Text to Columns** option: one for the agent's name and another for their code.
- Remove extra spaces in the Brand column using the **TRIM()** function.
- Review the spelling in the Product Name column using **Review > Spelling** option and correct entries such as "Phoen" to "Phone" and "Chargeer" to "Charger."
- Remove duplicate rows using the **Data > Remove Duplicates** option (nine duplicates removed).
- Delete the unnecessary columns (Invoice and Code) for analysis.

### üîÑ Data Transformation

- Create the Year and Month columns using the Date column and the formula **=TEXT(value, format_text)**.
- Create the Total_Cost column by multiplying Cost per Unit and Quantity using the arithmetic operator **\***.
- Create the Total_Profit column by subtracting Total_Cost from Total_Revenue using the arithmetic operator **-**.
