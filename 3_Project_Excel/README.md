## üß≠ Project Workflow

### üîç Data Preparation and Exploration
- Open the Excel file Project.xlsx.
- Create a copy of the Raw_data sheet.
- Rename the copied sheet as Clean_data.
- Convert the data in the Clean_data sheet into a table format.

### üßπ Data Cleaning

The result of the data cleaning process is shown in the Clean_data sheet.
- Apply the European date format **(DD-MM-YYYY)** to the Date column.
- Capitalize names in the Commercial Agent using the **PROPER()** function.
- Split the text in the Commercial Agent column into two columns using the **Data > Text to Columns** option: one for the agent's name and another for their code.
- Remove extra spaces in the Brand column using the **TRIM()** function.
- Review the spelling in the Product Name column using **Review > Spelling** option and correct entries such as "Phoen" to "Phone" and "Chargeer" to "Charger."
- Remove duplicate rows using the **Data > Remove Duplicates** option (nine duplicates removed).
- Delete the unnecessary columns (Invoice and Code) for analysis.

### üîÑ Data Transformation

- Create the Year and Month columns using the Date column and the  **TEXT()** function.
- Create the Total_Cost column by multiplying Cost per Unit and Quantity using the arithmetic operator.
- Create the Total_Profit column by subtracting Total_Cost from Total_Revenue using the arithmetic operator.
  
### üìà Analysis

The dataset was analyzed using two approaches:  
**1)** formulas combined with conditional formatting to extract insights  

| Metric                                     | Function / Arithmetic Operator | Conditional formatting |                                               
|--------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Total Revenue<br>Total Cost<br>Total Profit| SUM()    | NA                                           |
| Profit Margin                              | /        | NA                                           |
| Profit per Month and Year                  | SUMIFS() | Data Bars > Gradient Fill > Green Data Bars  |
| Profit by Brand and Sales Agent            | SUMIFS() | New Rule > Rule created to identify the sales agent generating the highest profit per brand |
| Profit by Brand and Product                | SUMIFS() | New Rule > Rules created to identify the product generating the highest and lowest profit per brand |
| Profit by Sales Agent<br>Profit by Brand<br>Profit by Product| SUMIF() | Data Bars > Gradient Fill > Green Data Bars |

**2)** pivot tables to build the dynamic charts displayed in the dashboard.
