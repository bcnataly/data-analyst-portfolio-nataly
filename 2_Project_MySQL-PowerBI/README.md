## üìå Project Overview

The Techniserv Group, a U.S. technology company, commissioned a human resources data analysis focusing on its employees. The project aimed to provide valuable insights into the demographics, distribution, and compensation of the workforce and create a visual report to communicate this information to senior HR management and other stakeholders.
The project utilized MySQL for data preparation, exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analysis, and Power BI for executive-level visualization.

### üîç Data Preparation and Exploration
- Create the database.
- Import the table from a .csv file (employees.csv).
- Review the number of rows and columns.
- Check data types.
- Display the first few rows of the table.
- Understand the information contained in each column of the dataset:
  
| Column Name         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `id_employee`       | Unique identifier for each employee |
| `first_name`        | Employee's first name |

-	Standardize categorical levels to English.
-	Replace the integer values with categorical values.
-	Adjust the number format to a numerical column and the date format to a date column.
-	Drop irrelevant columns.

### üîÑ Data Transformation
-	Create a column to calculate the age of each employee.
-	Create a column to calculate annual salary in USD.
-	Assign appropriate data types to the new columns.
-	Remove columns that are not needed for the analysis.

### üìà Analysis

The dataset was analyzed using SQL queries to extract insights. 

-	Total number of employees.
-	Average annual salary per employee.
-	Average employee age.
-	Distribution by department, gender, and work modality.
-   Highest-paid employees.
-	Average annual salary by gender.

### üíæ Save Cleaned Data

The final cleaned table is saved in the **clean_employees.csv** file and used as the data source for visualization in Power BI.

### üìä Data Visualization

The dashboard uses visual elements to present key insights about the Techniserv Group workforce. Data visualization is available in both the **dashboard.pbix** Power BI file and the **dashboard.pdf** file.
